# Final_project
# Personalized Video Generation

This project automates the creation of **educational videos** using **Generative AI**. Users can input any query (e.g., "Explain Pythagoras Theorem"), and the system generates:
- A relevant explanation using Google Gemini (Generative AI),
- AI-generated images with Stable Diffusion,
- Voice narration with gTTS (Text-to-Speech),
- A complete video using MoviePy,
- A quiz based on the video with answer evaluation using Sentence Transformers.

### üîç Use Case
- Personalized learning content
- Rapid creation of explainer videos
- Interactive educational tools

## üß† AI Workflow

1. **Text Explanation**:  
   Gemini generates a structured explanation for the topic.

2. **Prompt Engineering**:  
   The explanation is turned into **visual prompts** for each scene.

3. **Image Generation**:  
   Each prompt is fed into **Stable Diffusion** to generate matching visuals.

4. **Voice Generation**:  
   The explanation is converted into **audio using gTTS**.

5. **Video Creation**:  
   Images + Voice + Captions combined using **MoviePy**.

6. **Quiz Creation & Evaluation**:  
   - Gemini generates a quiz question.  
   - User answers it.  
   - Score is calculated using **semantic similarity**.
